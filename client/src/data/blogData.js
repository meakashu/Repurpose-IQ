# The AI Revolution in Drug Repurposing

The traditional drug discovery pipeline is broken. It takes an average of **10-15 years** and **$2.6 billion** to bring a new drug to market. But what if the cure for Alzheimer's, Cancer, or Rare Diseases is already sitting on the pharmacy shelf, approved for something else?

## The Data Deluge

We are drowning in biomedical data:
- 35 million+ PubMed citations
- Millions of clinical trial records
- Petabytes of genomic data

Human researchers cannot possibly synthesize all this information. This is where **RepurposeIQ** comes in.

## Multi-Agent Intelligence

Our platform uses a swarm of specialized AI agents:
1. **Analyst Agent**: Scours literature for mechanism-of-action matches.
2. **Clinical Agent**: Evaluates safety profiles and trial feasibility.
3. **Patent Agent**: Checks intellectual property landscapes.

> "Repurposing is not just about finding new uses; it's about saving lives faster." - *Akash Kumar Singh, Founder*

## Case Study: Metformin

We recently identified a potential new application for Metformin in treating a specific subtype of fibrosis. Our AI agents highlighted a pathway overlap that had been overlooked for years.

## Conclusion

The future of medicine isn't just about discovering new molecules—it's about rediscovering the ones we already have.

# Navigating Regulatory Pathways

One of the biggest advantages of drug repurposing is the **regulatory shortcut**.

## The 505(b)(2) Pathway

In the US, the FDA's 505(b)(2) pathway allows manufacturers to rely on existing safety data for a drug that has already been approved.

### Key Benefits:
- **Reduced Clinical Trials**: Phase 1 safety trials can often be skipped.
- **Lower Costs**: Development costs are slashed by up to 60%.
- **Faster Approval**: Review times are significantly shorter.

## Our Approach at RepurposeIQ

Our **Regulatory Agent** automatically scans guidance documents and precedent cases to generate a regulatory strategy report for every candidate drug we identify.

# Rare Diseases: A Hidden Market

While "rare" diseases affect a small percentage of the population individually, collectively they impact **400 million people worldwide**.

## The Orphan Drug Act

Incentives for developing treatments for rare diseases include:
1. **7 years of market exclusivity**
2. **Tax credits** for clinical testing expenses
3. **Waiver of FDA user fees**

## AI-Driven Market Sizing

RepurposeIQ doesn't just find scientific matches; we assess commercial viability. Our dashboard provides real-time estimates of:
- Patient population size
- Competitor density
- Pricing potential

## Conclusion

Focusing on rare diseases is not just an ethical imperative—it's a smart business strategy.
