# How to Assemble Your Winning Submission

I have generated all the content you need for the **EY Techathon 6.0 Detailed Executive Summary**.

## Step 1: Fill the PPT Slides
Open your PPT file (`692ab8680198f_EY_Techathon_6.0__Detailed_Executive_Summary.pptx`) and copy-paste the content from `SUBMISSION_CONTENT.md`.

-   **Slide 4 (Executive Summary)**: Copy the "Executive Summary" section. It is exactly ~200 words and packed with high-scoring ATS keywords (Agentic AI, RAG, Pharmaceutical Intelligence).
-   **Slide 5 (Problem Statement)**: Use the table data I provided. It matches the "Pharma" problem statement perfectly.
-   **Slide 6 (Approach)**: Copy the 7 points. They are technical and business-focused.

## Step 2: Add Diagrams (Slide 7)
Use `DIAGRAMS.md` to generate your images.
1.  Copy the **Mermaid code** into a Mermaid Live Editor (https://mermaid.live) or use a VS Code extension to preview it.
2.  **Export as PNG/SVG**.
3.  Paste the **Architecture Diagram** and **Process Flow Chart** into Slide 7.
4.  Take screenshots of your running app (Dashboard, Chat) and paste them as "Wireframes/Screenshots".

## Step 3: Record the Demo (Slide 8)
For the video, record a 3-4 minute screen capture covering:
1.  **Login**: Show the professional login screen.
2.  **Query**: Type "Find repurposing opportunities for Metformin".
3.  **Agent Action**: **Crucial** - Mouse over the "Agents thinking..." logs to show it's doing real work (searching PubMed, checking Patents).
4.  **Result**: Show the structured answer (Market Size, Competition).
5.  **Report**: Click "Generate PDF" and open the resulting PDF.

## Winning Tips (ATS & Scoring)
-   **Buzzwords**: I've included "LangGraph", "Multi-Modal", "RAG", "Regulatory Compliance", "Microservices".
-   **Visuals**: The diagrams are professional and show "Enterprise Grade" architecture.
-   **Clarity**: The problem statement clearly identifies the "Data Silo" pain point.

Go get that win! 🚀
